There're all useful strings for importing to WeakAuras2 for ALL specs and classes in this branch. All utilities, CC's,
rotations, essentials for every class in WoW.

!!! INSTALL OmniCC Addon\analogue !!!

To import strings to your addon, you should click "RAW" and select all the text with CTRL+A and copy it with CTRL+C.
Next you should go to your /wa in game, select "New Indication", you will see "import" option down there - push it and copy
string from this GitHub. Wait for about 10 seconds, press "import" somewhere on your dekstop, so that's it ^_^.

Importation Process:
For Excample, you would like to choose a Shadow Priest.
- Enter "PriestUI".
- Copy all groups from this Main folder(no exceptions):
 	- Priest_CC(All CC and PvP dmg abilities for Priest Class)
    	- Priest_Utilites (All utilities, saves, movement CDs, long CDs etc)
    	- Priest_Essential (Every save\movement\rare procs buffs on you)
    	- So for other classes you can find some different groupes, and much more(like with druids)
- Enter "Shadow" Folder and copy all string the same way.
